# Pluralsight Course Files

This repository houses course files for Pluralsight courses created by James Bannan.
The courses are available [at Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/james-bannan "Pluralsight").

## Update: September 2019

I have added assets for the demos in the course <strong>Manage Kubernetes Infrastructure</strong>, which is part of the Azure DevOps Engineer Learning Path.

You can find these assets in the [azure-devops-kubernetes-infrastructure](azure-devops-kubernetes-infrastructure) folder, which contains resources for demoing deployments of AKS using both [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and [Hashicorp Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) as well as deploying a [multi-tier microservices application](https://microservices-demo.github.io/) to AKS.
